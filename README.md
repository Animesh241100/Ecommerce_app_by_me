This product is not complete, it is just for display for my fellow group members to know the progress of the product. If one downloads the whole file, if he sets up his virtual environment accordingly and after going into 'src' folder if he runs 'python manage.py runserver' the link in the output if opened in any browser locally can show the progress of Animesh Kumar into this project. If any of you want to make anychanges just git clone the project into your system and make every change locally. If you are going to make any change locally, you are expected to have watched both the recommended tutorials by Animesh Kumar, or at least the first tutorial fully.
